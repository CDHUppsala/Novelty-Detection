    "The number of patents in the sets $\\mathcal{B}_{j, \\tau}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{j, \\tau}$ varies for each patent. For a patent $p$ the number of patents in $\\mathcal{B}{j, \\tau}$ or $\\mathcal{F}_{j, \\tau}$ may be high, which leads to a high BS or FS (or vice versa), even though each individual similarity between $p$ and all other patents in these sets is low. Therefore, the number of patents in each set heavily influences the BS and FS scores, which in return determines the importance score. On the other hand, the actual individual similarity scores used to calculate FS and BS do not influence the importance scores as they are supposed to. "

This corresponds to taking the average. The resulting formulas are the following:\n",
